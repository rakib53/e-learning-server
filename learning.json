    "description": "Python is widely regarded as a programming language that easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++. In fact, its the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. “You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and its relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand",

When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to produce web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser, which can be used to build games and communication applications that run directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the functionality of JavaScript as well. ",
